<h1>Difference Image</h1>
<hr>
<p>We are using DICOM images again, same as in pixel data and transforming them the same way to display them as greyscale
    images in the browser.

    <p>Each set consists of 2 consecutive images. The first image is the reference image, the second image shown is the
        difference image between image 1 and image 2. To the right of it you can see the pixel data of the difference.

    <p>The difference image is calculated by subtracting the pixel values of the two images. The result is a new image
    where the pixel values are the difference between the two images. The difference image is then displayed as a
    greyscale image.

    <p>Difference images can be useful to highlight changes but also to sometimes greatly reduce the size of the data by
    removing redundant information such as pixel values that do not change over the course of an image series or video.
