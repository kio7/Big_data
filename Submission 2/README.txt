This webapp is made using the Flask framework in Python, and 
it requires many modules to be installed if you wish to run
and try the application on your on system. However, we have
made videos for each task and sub-task, so if you have problems
running the application you have the option to watch these to
see our results. 

The "requirements.txt" contains all the modules with correct
the correct module versions that is needed. To install all
the required modules, run the following command in your
terminal:

"
pip install -r requirements.txt
"

Make sure your installed python version is up to date, and that your
environment runs on the same version. Run this command to check 
what Python version you have installed:

"
python --version
"
